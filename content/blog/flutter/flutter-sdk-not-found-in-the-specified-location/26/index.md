Flutter is a mobile development SDK developed by Google. The best part of using Flutter is that you can create cross-platform applications which perform as good as native apps.

If you are creating your first Flutter App then there is a high probability that you will run into the issue of ‘Flutter SDK not found in the specified location Error’. No matter how many time you install the SDK, this message won’t go.

#### To fix the flutter SDK not found error, please follow the steps below:

1. Go to Menu > Tools > SDK Manager > Android SDK (left side of the dialog) > SDK Tools (tab).
2. Select ‘Support Repository’ and ‘NDK’ checkboxes.
3. Click OK.
4. It will prompt you to install some dependencies. Install them.

Phew! You are done. Try creating your Flutter project once again and this time it will be a smooth ride.
